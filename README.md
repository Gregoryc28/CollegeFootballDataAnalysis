# College Football Data Analysis

A predictive analytics system for college football games that uses statistical modeling and historical data to forecast game outcomes, point spreads, and over/under lines.

## Overview

This project leverages college football data from various sources to build predictive models that analyze team performance and forecast game results with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Game Outcome Prediction**: Forecast winners of upcoming games based on historical performance
- **Point Spread Calculation**: Generate point spread predictions for matchups
- **Over/Under Line Analysis**: Predict total points scored in games with verified accuracy against betting lines
- **Conference-Based Multipliers**: Adjust predictions based on conference strength for improved accuracy
- **Team Stats Analysis**: Identify key performance indicators most correlated with wins and losses
- **SEC Focus**: Special analysis and predictions for Southeastern Conference games

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy for statistical analysis
- **API Integration**: College Football Data API access for team and game information
- **Statistical Modeling**: Custom algorithms for predictive analytics
- **Data Storage**: CSV-based data storage with structured organization

## How It Works

The system analyzes historical team performance data to identify statistical correlations with wins and losses. It uses these correlations to build predictive models that forecast game outcomes. Conference-based multipliers are applied to account for varying levels of competition across different conferences.

## Usage

The main script provides several functions:

- `predict_this_weeks_games()`: Forecast winners for all games in the current week
- `predict_this_weeks_SEC_games()`: Generate detailed predictions for SEC games
- `get_current_week_most_guaranteed()`: Identify games with highest prediction confidence
- `check_prior_SEC_overUnder_accuracy()`: Validate prediction accuracy against previous results

## Model Accuracy

The system has demonstrated the following accuracy rates:
- SEC game winner prediction: 80%+ success rate
- Over/Under predictions: Validated against betting lines with strong correlation

## Data Sources

- College Football Data API for team, game, and statistical information
- Historical performance data from 2017-2023 seasons

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate weather data for game day conditions
- Add player-specific metrics for injury impact analysis
- Implement machine learning algorithms for improved prediction accuracy
- Develop web interface for easier interaction with predictions
